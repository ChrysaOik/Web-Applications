                    <p>
                        I am studying computer science and it is a field that I had a feel for since the first years of high school. I like to code
                        <br>and I have chosen the pathways of Information Systems and Information Security and Databases and Knowledge Management.
                        <br>Apart from informatics, I also like foreign languages and as a result I am able to speak English, French and I am currently
                        <br>learning Spanish.
